to launch the game, double click the "Ashbound" shortcut from the root directory or navigate
to:

desktop -> build -> libs

and then double click the Ashbound executable. From the main menu, you can press F1
to skip straight to the game (a debug shortcut), and in-game, you can F3 to enable
hitbox debug and F5 to enable fullscreen (though fullscreen is experimental, so expect
bugs).

the goal is simply to kill as many zombies as you can before death. this is a
rough, fundamental concept of the combat retooled into a game rather than the direction
i ultimately want the final direction of the game to move towards, so take the difference
in tone between the main menu and the game with a grain of salt.
